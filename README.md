**Explainable AI for Predictive Customer Behavior and Demand Forecasting in E-Commerce**
An interactive web-based dashboard that provides explainable predictions for customer churn and product demand forecasting using machine learning models with transparent feature importance analysis.

Customer retention and accurate demand forecasting are critical components of modern data-driven business strategies. This project presents an integrated Explainable AI (XAI) Dashboard for Customer Churn Prediction and Product Demand Forecasting, enabling decision-makers to not only predict key business outcomes but also understand the underlying factors influencing these predictions.

The system leverages machine learning models—specifically a MultiOutput LightGBM Classifier for churn prediction and a LightGBM Regressor for demand forecasting. These models are deployed within an interactive web-based dashboard built using Plotly Dash and Bootstrap, allowing users to explore model behavior, visualize feature importance, and perform real-time predictions with new inputs.

To enhance model transparency, explainability techniques such as feature contribution analysis and importance visualization are incorporated, highlighting how each input variable affects the prediction. The dashboard dynamically adjusts between model overview and prediction modes, providing an intuitive and user-friendly interface for both technical and non-technical users.

This project demonstrates how combining predictive analytics with explainable AI principles can transform raw data into actionable insights, fostering better business decisions in customer relationship management and inventory planning.
